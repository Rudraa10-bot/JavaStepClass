String built-in split() method and return the words. Use the following logic
i. Firstly Count the number of words in the text and create an array to store the
indexes of the spaces for each word in a 1D array
ii. Then Create an array to store the words and use the indexes to extract the words
d. Create a method to compare the two String arrays and return a boolean
e. The main function calls the user-defined method and the built-in split() method. Call the
user defined method to compare the two string arrays and display the result
